# Gap Statistic Method

The gap statistic has been published by R. Tibshirani, G. Walther, and T. Hastie (Standford University, 2001). The approach can be applied to any clustering method.

The gap statistic compares the total within intra-cluster variation for different values of k with their expected values under null reference distribution of the data. The estimate of the optimal clusters will be value that maximize the gap statistic (i.e, that yields the largest gap statistic). This means that the clustering structure is far away from the random uniform distribution of points.
